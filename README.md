## **Tic Tac Toe** <br/>
##### https://github.com/thejessicafelts/technology__games--tic-tac-toe.git <br/>
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players, X and O, take turns to mark the cells. The objective is to get three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The game detects winning conditions and announces the winner, or declares a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
