## **Tic Tac Toe** <br/>
##### https://github.com/thejessicafelts/technology__games--tic-tac-toe.git <br/>
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players, X and O, take turns marking cells. The objective is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game detects winners, announces results, and declares a draw if all cells are filled without a winner. A sidebar displays scores, and a modal with instructions appears on each page load.
